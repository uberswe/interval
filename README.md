# interval

Interval is a simple package which uses Gos time.Duration to perform different functions.

With the DoEvery functions it is possible to call a function in Golang every x seconds. Depending on the function you can do this in a blocking or asyncronous way.

It is also possible to check if enough time has passed between two times. Such as checking if something has executed 7 days before today for example.
